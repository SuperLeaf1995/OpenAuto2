# OpenAuto2
GTA2 clone made in JavaScript with multiplayer.

# Run
To run execute on the root folder of the project (where README.md is on): ``npm i``.
wait for all dependencies to install, then enter the /server/ directory and input ``node index.js``, this will create a server on ``localhost:5000``, open your favorite web browser and enter there.
You're now hosting a local server.
For letting everyone to connect to your newly-made server, you need to set a static IP and port forward port 5000, make ExpressJS listen to the LAN address you forwarded, and that should be all.
